# CIFAR10-Optimizers (CNN)
### _Comparison of different optimizers on the __CIFAR-10__ dataset_.
---

Choosing the right optimizer while working on a Deep Learning project is very important. In this small project, I illustrate the performance of different optimizers on a basic CNN.


## Model

- Python 3
- Keras (Tensorflow backend)
- CIFAR-10 dataset
